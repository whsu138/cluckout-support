    <h1>CluckOut Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>CluckOut is a time tracking app. This policy describes what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>All your time entries, categories, reminders, and settings are stored <strong>only on your device</strong>
            using Apple’s Core Data. We do not upload this data to our servers. The app works offline. You can export or
            delete your data at any time from within the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>CluckOut shows banner ads provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. We use <strong>non-personalized ads
                only</strong> (no personalized targeting based on your behavior). We do not use the Advertising
            Identifier (IDFA) for ad targeting.</p>
        <p>AdMob may collect device-related information (e.g. coarse location, device type) as described in <a
                href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
            For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK, we use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to
            obtain consent where required before showing ads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="revoke-consent">
        <h2>Revoke Consent &amp; Ad Choices</h2>
        <p>You can change or withdraw your consent for advertising at any time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In the app:</strong> If we show a consent message (e.g. in EEA/UK), you can decline or change
                your choice when the message is shown again (e.g. after reinstall or app update).</li>
            <li><strong>On your device:</strong> On iOS, go to <strong>Settings → Privacy &amp; Security →
                    Tracking</strong> and turn off “Allow Apps to Request to Track” or disable tracking for CluckOut.
                This limits cross-app tracking; CluckOut will still show non-personalized ads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because we use non-personalized ads only and do not use IDFA for targeting, revoking consent mainly affects
            optional personalized elements. You can also uninstall the app to stop all data processing by CluckOut.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on where you live, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Since we do not
            store your data on our servers, your time-tracking data is under your control on your device. You can export
            it (Settings → Record Management → Export) or delete it (Settings → Record Management → Clear Records) at
            any time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>For privacy-related questions, use the support link in the App Store listing or the in-app support options.
