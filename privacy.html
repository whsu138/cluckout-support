    <h1>CluckOut Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Controller</h2>
        <p>CluckOut is the data controller for the processing described in this policy. For privacy requests and
            questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:hsudev138@gmail.com">hsudev138@gmail.com</a> or via the support
            link in the App Store listing or the in-app support options.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>CluckOut is a time tracking app. This policy describes what data we collect, how we use it, and your
            choices. The app is not directed at children under 13 (or 16 in the EEA/UK); we do not knowingly collect
            personal information from children.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Legal Basis &amp; Retention (EEA/UK)</h2>
        <p>For users in the European Economic Area and UK: we process your on-device data to provide the app under our
            contract with you; we process data for ads based on your consent (obtained via Google's consent tool where
            required). Your time-tracking data stays on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app. Ad-related
            data retention is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>All your time entries, categories, reminders, and settings are stored <strong>only on your device</strong>
            using Apple's Core Data. We do not upload this data to our servers. The app works offline. You can export or
            delete your data at any time from within the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Categories of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not collect personal information on our servers. On your device we process: time entries, categories,
            reminders, and app settings (stored locally). For advertising, our provider (Google AdMob) may receive
            device-related information (e.g. coarse location, device type) as described in <a
                href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
            We use this only for non-personalized ads. We do not use the Advertising Identifier (IDFA) for
            targeting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>CluckOut shows banner ads provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. We use <strong>non-personalized ads
                only</strong> (no personalized targeting based on your behavior). We do not use the Advertising
            Identifier (IDFA) for ad targeting.</p>
        <p>AdMob may collect device-related information (e.g. coarse location, device type) as described in <a
                href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
            For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK, we use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) to
            obtain consent where required before showing ads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="revoke-consent">
        <h2>Revoke Consent &amp; Ad Choices</h2>
        <p>You can change or withdraw your consent for advertising at any time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In the app:</strong> If we show a consent message (e.g. in EEA/UK), you can decline or change
                your choice when the message is shown again (e.g. after reinstall or app update).</li>
            <li><strong>On your device:</strong> On iOS, go to <strong>Settings → Privacy &amp; Security →
                    Tracking</strong> and turn off “Allow Apps to Request to Track” or disable tracking for CluckOut.
                This limits cross-app tracking; CluckOut will still show non-personalized ads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because we use non-personalized ads only and do not use IDFA for targeting, revoking consent mainly affects
            optional personalized elements. You can also uninstall the app to stop all data processing by CluckOut.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not store your time-tracking data on our servers, that data is under your control on your device.
            You can <strong>export</strong> it (Settings → Record Management → Export) or <strong>delete</strong> it
            (Settings → Record Management → Clear Records) at any time.</p>
        <p><strong>EEA / UK (GDPR):</strong> You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, and
            object to processing of your data; the right to data portability (we support this via export); the right to
            withdraw consent at any time (see <a href="#revoke-consent">Revoke Consent &amp; Ad Choices</a>); and the
            right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority in your country.</p>
        <p><strong>US state privacy rights (e.g. California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah):</strong> Depending
            on your state, you may have the right to know what personal information we collect, to delete it, to
            correct it, to opt out of “sale” or “sharing” (see below), to opt out of targeted advertising, and to
            non-discrimination for exercising these rights. Use the in-app controls above or contact us via the support
            link in the App Store, in-app support, or <a href="mailto:hsudev138@gmail.com">hsudev138@gmail.com</a> to
            exercise your rights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="california-privacy">
        <h2>Your California Privacy Choices / Do Not Sell or Share</h2>
        <p>We do not <strong>sell</strong> your personal information. We use Google AdMob for non-personalized ads only
            and do not use IDFA for targeting. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA), “sharing” for
            cross-context behavioral advertising may still apply to some ad tech; we do not share personal information
            for cross-context behavioral advertising.</p>
        <p>If you are a California resident and wish to exercise your right to know, delete, correct, or opt out of sale
            or sharing, use the in-app options (export/delete, ad consent) or contact us at <a
                href="mailto:hsudev138@gmail.com">hsudev138@gmail.com</a> or via the support link in the App Store or
            in-app support. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.</p>
