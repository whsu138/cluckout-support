    <h1>CluckOut Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>CluckOut is a time tracking app. This policy describes what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>All your time entries, categories, reminders, and settings are stored <strong>only on your device</strong>
            using Apple’s Core Data. We do not upload this data to our servers. The app works offline. You can export or
            delete your data at any time from within the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>CluckOut shows banner ads provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. We use <strong>non-personalized ads
                only</strong> (no personalized targeting based on your behavior). We do not use the Advertising
            Identifier (IDFA) for ad targeting.</p>
        <p>AdMob may collect device-related information (e.g. coarse location, device type) as described in <a
                href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
            For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK, we use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to
            obtain consent where required before showing ads. For users in certain US states, we also provide consent
            and
            opt-out choices as required by state privacy laws.</p>
        <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong> We do not share your personal information for
            cross-context behavioral advertising. Ad delivery may involve sharing limited device-related data with
            Google and its partners under our contract with Google; you can manage or withdraw consent via the in-app
            consent message or the options below.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="revoke-consent">
        <h2>Revoke Consent &amp; Ad Choices</h2>
        <p>You can change or withdraw your consent for advertising at any time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In the app:</strong> Use “Manage options” or “Do not consent” when the consent message is shown
                (e.g. in EEA/UK or certain US states). After you have already chosen, the message may appear again after
                reinstall or an app update so you can change your choice.</li>
            <li><strong>On your device:</strong> On iOS, go to <strong>Settings → Privacy &amp; Security →
                    Tracking</strong> and turn off “Allow Apps to Request to Track” or disable tracking for CluckOut.
                This limits cross-app tracking; CluckOut will still show non-personalized ads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because we use non-personalized ads only and do not use IDFA for targeting, revoking consent mainly affects
            optional personalized elements. You can also uninstall the app to stop all data processing by CluckOut.</p>
        <p><strong>Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information (US residents):</strong> We do not sell personal
            information. To limit use of your data for ad-related purposes, use “Do not consent” or “Manage options”
            in the in-app consent message, or the device settings above.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p><strong>Everyone:</strong> You can access, correct, or delete your time-tracking data at any time. Since we
            do not store your data on our servers, it stays on your device. Export it (Settings → Record Management →
            Export) or delete it (Settings → Record Management → Clear Records) from within the app.</p>
        <p><strong>EEA / UK (GDPR):</strong> You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, and
            object, and to withdraw consent at any time (see Revoke Consent &amp; Ad Choices above). You also have the
            right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country.</p>
        <p><strong>US states (e.g. California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah):</strong> You may have the right
            to know, delete, or correct personal information, and to opt out of “sale” or “share.” We do not sell
            personal information. To opt out of ad-related use, use the in-app consent options or device settings above.
            We do not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Controller &amp; Contact</h2>
        <p>The data controller for CluckOut is the developer identified in the App Store listing. For privacy-related
            questions or to exercise your rights, use the support link in the App Store listing or the in-app support
            options.</p>
