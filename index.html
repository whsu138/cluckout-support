            <h3>Why is the reminder toggle disabled?</h3>
            <p>The reminder toggle is disabled when notification permission is not granted. This ensures that reminders
                only work when properly configured. To enable it:</p>
            <p>• If you haven't granted permission yet: Tap "Request Notification Permission"<br>
                • If permission was denied: Tap "Open Settings" to enable notifications in iOS Settings</p>
            <p><strong>New in 1.2.2:</strong> Automatic permission checking prevents reminders from being enabled
                without proper notification setup.</p>
